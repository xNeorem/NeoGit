Introduction
============
A peer-to-peer network that implements the basic functions of the Git protocol. Users can create, clone, add files, edit a repository.
Thanks to the peer-to-peer network the repositories are shared and each user can collaborate on each repository.

Problem Statement
================
Design and develop the Git protocol, distributed versioning control on a P2P network.
Each peer can manage its projects (a set of files) using the Git protocol (a minimal version). 
The system allows the users to create a new repository in a specific folder, add new files to be tracked by the system, 
apply the changing on the local repository (commit function), push the networkâ€™s changes, and pull the changing from the network.
The git protocol has lot-specific behavior to manage the conflicts; in this version, it is only required that if there are some conflicts,
the systems can download the remote copy, and the merge is manually done. 
As described in the [GitProtocol Java API](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems-unisa/blob/master/homework/GitProtocol.java).

Solution Approach
=================
A file system has been developed for the correct management of the repositories.

Each repository has its own file, `data.ng`, which will be generated at the time of creation or at the moment of its cloning from the network and will be stored inside the
repository folder.

All changes made by the network user are stored in this file.

On the other hand, when a peer on the network starts up, another file, `repos.ng`, is created or loaded into memory, which contains the paths relative to the "data.ng" files of each repository.

This system allows you not to lose the changes made in previous peer runs.

Additional Features
=============
In addition to the basic operations defined by the [GitProtocol Java API](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems-unisa/blob/master/homework/GitProtocol.java), I have been developed:

1. Clone Repository.
2. Show Local History, to view the commits made in a repository
3. Show file in Repository, to view all files present in a Repository

So you can view the new interface [here](./src/main/java/it/unisa/neogit/GitProtocol.java).

Deployment
========
Implementation details
--------------------
As described in the upper sections, files are used for managing repositories. To avoid that the system for each operation to a repository has to load the information contained in its data.ng file, an instance variable is used which keeps the repository object currently used. Obviously, before carrying out any operation, it is first verified that the repository matches the one with which we really want to carry out an operation.

Project structure
---------------

- src/main/java/it/unisa/neogit/entity
  
  *package that contains all entities needing to create a peer-to-peer repository*

  - _**Commit.java**_: Class that models a commit of a repository
  - _**Repository.java**_: Class that models a local repository
  - _**RepositoryP2P.java**_: Class that extends a repository to model a remote repository.
- src/main/java/it/unisa/neogit/
  - _**GitProtocol.java**_: Interface for the methods needed for some features of the git protocol.
  - _**NeoGit.java**_: Concrete class that implements the interfaces defined in GitProtocol.
  - _**NeoGitRunner.java**_: Startup class

- **Dockerfile**: A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
- _**pom.xml**_: File needed for a maven project. It contains the dependencies and instructions for creating the `.jar`.
